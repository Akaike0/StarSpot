  - STARSPOT SHORT QA -
----------------------------

Q: My character doesn't select monsters!
A: Set your ingame key settings to default. Turn off TeamViewer, Fraps and restart your computer, make sure it stays off.

Q: My character doesn't attack or the skills acts strange.
A: Here are few solutions:

1. Set your ingame key settings to default. Turn off TeamViewer, Fraps and restart your computer, make sure it stays off.
2. Set your keyboard layout to English and make sure your hotbar keys ingame are like this: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
3. Increase your "Search Range". If you set it to 50 or 100 it will attack mostly everything, but you will have maybe some problems with stucking.
4. Increase your "Attack unstucking" activation time. Default is 4 but if you set it to for example 8 or 10 it will acativate it later.
5. Turn off all your addons except MatchQ and JunkIT.
6. Delete the StarSpot.settings file and reconfigurate everything.
7. Make sure you use the action set 1 and the action bar is enabled under HUD in Wildstar.
8. Reset your Wildstar HUD and Interface! Enable all the elements in the HUD menu.

Q: StarSpot crashes .
A: Install .Net Framework 4.5 which you can download from the official Microsoft website.

Q: My character doesn't sell and repair his items.
A: First of all you need to enable this option under: Config - Other - Page 2, then you need an
Wildstar addon like JunkIt which you can find here: 
http://www.curse.com/ws-addons/wildstar/220002-junkit

Q: It tries to use skills which have cooldown!
A: Make sure you use the first action set. Click ingame "B" and make sure there is a label which says: "Action Set 1".

Q: My chat windows opens often and the bot stucks!
A: Change in Wildstar the key "CTRL + R" to reply, to something else like to "*".

Q: Where can I find a tutorial for StarSpot?!
A: On the official website: http://star.gplays.co

Q: Can I run more than one session on my computer?
A: Yes, you can run as many StarSpot clients as your computer can handle. To create for each character an
own profile, just create a fresh folder with a StarSpot client.

Q: Can I run one licence on more than one computer?
A: Yes, but not at the same time and each time you want to use another computer, you have to validate the key again.

Q: Where can I find my config file?
A: Your config file should be in the same folder as StartSpot and name is: StarSpot.settings. It's NOT StarSpot.config!

Q: Is this bot save?
A: Yes and no. You can always get banned by reports or server scripts which collect data.
But StarSpot doesn't use injection and detour functions. You can use the "Player detection" option to
avoid player reports.
